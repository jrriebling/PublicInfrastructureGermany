# PublicInfrastructureGermany

This repository consists of four network datasets 
containing information on different parts of the 
german transportation infrastructure. The data is
provided in the [GraphML](http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/) and [GEXF](http://gexf.net/) format.

# Datasets

1. *autobahn_graph*: Contains a undirected graph of the german free- and motorway network (Autobahn). The nodes consists of the freeway exits, while connections between these exits are edges.
2. *domestic_flights_graph*: Undirected weighted graph with the number of connections between airports as edges.
3. *longdistance_trains_graph*: Network of longdistance trains (i.e. IC, ICE, EC) as edges and train stations as nodes.
